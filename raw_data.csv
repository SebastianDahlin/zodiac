Aquarius,"b"" Aquarius Zodiac Sign/nAquarians present themselves in one of two ways. One on hand, you'll see someone who is shy, and quiet.

Both personality types have an uncanny ability to see both sides of an argument without prejudice, making them excellent problem-solvers. While very much attuned to the energies around them, Aquarians have a deep need to take time out alone and away to rejuvenate themselves. The keyword for this sign is imagination.
